# ClarityChain

## Introduction
ClarityChain is a platform that simplifies the understanding of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and blockchain governance data. It transforms complex governance data into easy-to-read summaries, empowering users, DAO delegates, and community members to make more informed decisions.

## Features
- **Human-Readable Governance Insights**: Converts complex blockchain data into simple summaries.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Accessible even to users unfamiliar with blockchain technology.
- **Built on GaiaNet**: Leverages the power of GaiaNet for secure and decentralized processing.

## Project Purpose
This project aims to break down the complexities of blockchain governance for DAOs, making it easier for participants to navigate governance decisions and actively participate in decentralized ecosystems.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: GaiaNet API
- **Model**: Llama-3-8B 
- **Platform**: GaiaNet decentralized framework

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- GaiaNet node installed.
- Basic knowledge of DAOs and blockchain governance.

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/human-in-tech/gaianet-clarity-chain.git
   ```
   

2. **Navigate to the project directory**
  ```bash
  cd gaianet-clarity-chain
   ```


3. **Set Up Your GaiaNet Node**
  Ensure your GaiaNet node is running. If you haven't set it up yet, refer to [Gaia Documentation](https://github.com/human-in-tech/gaianet-clarity-chain/blob/main/GaiaNetDocumentation.md) for guidance.


4. **Generate Your API Key**
- Start your GaiaNet node.
- Open the URL provided for the ChatBot.
- Navigate to API Tutorial. Copy the API url.
  

5. **Replace the pre-set API key URL with your API key**
- Navigate to summary.js and locate the line that initializes the API key (apiUrl)
- Replace it with your newly generated key:
```javascript
  const apiUrl = 'YOUR_GENERATED_API_KEY_HERE';
```

  
6. Run the Project
- Navigate to index.html.
- Run the server live.
