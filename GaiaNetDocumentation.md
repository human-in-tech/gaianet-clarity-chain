ClarityChain is a platform designed to simplify the understanding of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and blockchain governance data. This documentation provides an overview of the project, the development process, and guidance for future contributors.

Project Overview
Goal: To transform complex governance data into easy-to-read insights for users unfamiliar with blockchain concepts.
Target Audience: DAO participants, blockchain enthusiasts, and newcomers seeking clarity in governance data.

Development Phase:
    ->Setting the Gaianet node in the environment
    ->Initialise the node using the command:-  gaianet init
    ->Selecting suitable GaiaNet model, we used Llama-3-8B model.
    ->Adding your own Knowledge Base using https://tools.gaianet.xyz/
    ->Modify the configuration of your node ,for instance change the parameters like system_prompt,rag_prompt,chat_size.
