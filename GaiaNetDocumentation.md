## Development Phase

1. **Setting the Gaianet Node in the Environment**:
   - Install and configure the Gaianet node within the development environment.

2. **Initialize the Node**:
   - Run the following command to initialize the node:
     ```bash
     gaianet init
     ```

3. **Selecting a Suitable GaiaNet Model**:
   - We utilized the `Llama-3-8B` model for optimal performance and results.

4. **Adding Your Own Knowledge Base**:
   - Access the tools and resources via [GaiaNet Tools](https://tools.gaianet.xyz/) to incorporate your own knowledge base.

5. **Modifying Node Configuration**:
   - Adjust the configuration parameters of your node, such as:
     - `system_prompt`
     - `rag_prompt`
     - `chat_size`

   Example configuration:
